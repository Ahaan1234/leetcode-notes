This repo is dedicated to archiving my solutions and attempts at various LeetCode problems, as I try to improve my skills over this Summer and beyond.

Problems Solved:
- Problem 23; Merge K Sorted Lists - Interesting exercise that I had to use buildHeap and downHeap methods for - I enjoyed the intersection of heaps and Linked Lists. Interesting how heaps make things so much more efficient.

- Problem 215; Kth Largest Element in List, Attempt 1: Array of length k that checks all elment (was inneficient). Final solution: Binary Min-Heap of length k, picked root after iterating through original array O(nlogk)

- Problem 97; Validate BST - Done but inneficient, 2 passes through nodes, one to make List, second to validate. Need to ideate on how to validate as I travel through the tree.

- Problem 1373 MaxSumBST - Algorithm in place, but inefficient. Needs to be remade to be faster. Considering creating a new class to pass through and store information, so I only need one pass through tree

- Problem 95; Unique Binary Search Trees

- Problem 94
